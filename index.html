</ol>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Authorized Contractors</strong><br>Our authorized contractors may need to access information about you when they require this information to perform their job. For example, a customer support representative would need access to your account to validate your identity and respond to your question or request; our email communications team would need access to your contact information to ensure this information is sent correctly and any unsubscribe requests are properly managed; and our security staff would need to review information to investigate attempted denial of service attacks, fraudulent account activity, or other attempts to compromise the Services.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">All our employees and contractors are required to agree to maintain the confidentiality and protect the privacy of your information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Service Providers, Authorized Resellers, and Partners</strong><br>We will share limited information about you to authorized service providers we use for marketing services, communicating with you, managing our customer database, the provision of professional services, and providing and managing the Services (including hosting data centers, securing our Services, and payment processing).</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">We may also participate in and run marketing events (e.g. conferences, webinars, and provide resources) with sponsors and other organizations. Where the sponsors or other organizations wish to collect your information for their marketing purposes, while we may facilitate this (e.g. information may be collected on the same registration form), they will be doing so independently under their own policies. We will advise you and provide you an opportunity for you to share your information with the sponsors or other organizations for such purposes, either upon registration or during the event.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Social Networks and Third-Party Services</strong><br>Where you are using our Services and have chosen to connect your Social Networks to the Services, or if you authorize a Third-Party Service to access your account, you are agreeing to provide information about you to the Social Networks and the Third-Party Services under their respective terms and privacy policies.

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Professional Advisors</strong><br>We may need to disclose information about you where we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or if we are otherwise legally required to do so, such as in response to a court order or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands. For governmental data access requests concerning you or your organization, we would first attempt to redirect the request to you and/or we would first attempt to notify you unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">In addition, we may disclose information about you if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action: (a) against illegal activities, fraud, situations involving potential threats to our rights or property (or to the rights or property of those who use our Services), or to protect the personal safety of any person; or (b) regarding situations that involve the security of our Services, abuse of the Services infrastructure, or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, or denial of service attacks).</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">We also use professional advisors, including lawyers and accountants, and may be required to disclose information about you when engaging them for their services and as necessary for audits, financial and other regulatory reviews.</p>
<ol start="6">
    <li>What international data transfers occur at RR autopost?<br>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws, information about you may only be transferred from your region to other regions if certain requirements are met. For instance, under the GDPR, information about you may be transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA if adequate data protections are in place.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Our Services are managed by RR autopost headquarters in USA. As the European Commission considers USA to be a country which provides adequate data protection, information about you may be transferred from the EEA to USA.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">RR autopost also uses third-party service providers, such as managed hosting providers, credit card processors, and technology partners to provide the software, networking, infrastructure and other services required to operate the Services. These third-party providers may process or store personal data on servers outside of the US. We rely on adequacy and standard contractual clauses (if sent to the US or onward to other countries) to ensure that information about you is lawfully transferred under EU law.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">By its nature, social media data can be shared with people around the globe. The Social Networks and Third-Party Services that you choose to integrate with our Services may collect, store, and process your information from various locations around the world according to their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
<ol start="7">
    <li>How do we safeguard your information?<br>RR autopost maintains industry standard security safeguards to protect your information. This includes ensuring our employees receive appropriate security and privacy training and guidance so they are aware of the measures they need to implement to protect your information.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Access controls are in place to limit access to your information to those who need it to perform their jobs. For example, information about you may be provided to our customer support specialists to help you with your requests. Individuals who are permitted to handle your information must adhere to confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">We encrypt data in transit and at rest, where appropriate, to ensure that your information is kept private. We undertake service provider security and privacy reviews to ensure that service providers follow our stringent requirements to safeguard your information, and we also enter into data protection agreements with our service providers. All payment information is fully encrypted and handled only by PCI certified organizations.</p>
<ol start="8">
    <li>How long do we retain your information?<br>In general for the RR autopost Services, we do not permanently store Content from Social Networks. Rather, when you login to the Services, we retrieve data from Social Networks in real time so that it is displayed in the platform for viewing during your session. We store other Content that you produce (such as draft Content for publication on Social Networks) so that you can easily access this material on the Services.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Aggregated data is used by RR autopost for analysis, product improvement, and troubleshooting purposes. In some cases, Content may continue to exist on the Social Networks even after you or we delete it from our Services, and you will need to contact the relevant Social Network directly if you want it to remove this Content.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">We retain your information as long as required to provide the Services requested by you, for record keeping purposes, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for the Services. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, or otherwise upon your request, we will dispose of it in a secure manner or anonymize the information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">As a data controller, suppose you require RR autopost to agree to data protection requirements under Article 28, GDPR, or UK data protection laws. In that case, RR autopost makes available a data processing addendum that meets these requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">If you are using the Services as an authorized user of a RR autopost customer (whether that customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual), that customer determines its own policies (if any) regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of personal data and Content, which may apply to your use of the Services.
