# 1) Use the official Nginx (lightweight Alpine version) as base
FROM nginx:alpine

# 2) Create a subfolder for the privacy policy inside Nginx's main html directory
#    so that your file can be reached at /privacy-policy.
RUN mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html/privacy-policy

# 3) Copy your HTML file into that new folder
COPY privacy-policy.html /usr/share/nginx/html/privacy-policy/index.html

# 4) Expose port 80 (Coolify will manage https for you if you configure it)
EXPOSE 80

# 5) Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
